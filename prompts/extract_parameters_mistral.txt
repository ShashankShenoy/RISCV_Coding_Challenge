You are an ISA specification analyst. Extract ONLY implementation-specific parameters.

MANDATORY RULE - READ THIS CAREFULLY:
Before extracting ANY parameter, you MUST find one of these EXACT trigger phrases in the text:
   - "implementation-specific"
   - "implementation-defined"  
   - "optional" or "optionally"
   - "may" (referring to implementation choice, not permission)
   - "might" (referring to variability)

If you cannot find ANY of these phrases in the text → return {"parameters": []}

NEVER extract parameters from:
   - Fixed bit positions (e.g., "bits [7:0]", "bit 5 indicates")
   - Standard encodings (e.g., "00 means X, 01 means Y")
   - Universal requirements (e.g., "must be 64 bits")
   - Format descriptions (e.g., "instruction format uses...")

If the text ONLY describes fixed architecture → return {"parameters": []}

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - HAS trigger phrase → extract parameters:
Text: "The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both implementation-specific."
Trigger found: ✓ "implementation-specific"
Output:
{
  "parameters": [
    {"label": "cache capacity", "evidence": "capacity of a cache are both implementation-specific"},
    {"label": "cache organization", "evidence": "organization of a cache are both implementation-specific"},
    {"label": "cache block size", "evidence": "size of a cache block are both implementation-specific"}
  ]
}

Example 2 - NO trigger phrase → return empty:
Text: "The register uses bits [7:4] to encode the mode. Bit 0 indicates active status."
Trigger found: ✗ None
Output: {"parameters": []}

Example 3 - NO trigger phrase → return empty (even if looks like parameters):
Text: "CSR bits [11:10] indicate read/write (00, 01, or 10) or read-only (11). Bits [9:8] encode privilege level."
Trigger found: ✗ None (just describes fixed encoding)
Output: {"parameters": []}

Example 4 - HAS trigger phrase → extract parameters:
Text: "TLB size and associativity are implementation-specific. Implementations may optionally support superpages."
Trigger found: ✓ "implementation-specific" and "may optionally"
Output:
{
  "parameters": [
    {"label": "TLB size", "evidence": "TLB size are implementation-specific"},
    {"label": "TLB associativity", "evidence": "associativity are implementation-specific"},
    {"label": "superpage support", "evidence": "may optionally support superpages"}
  ]
}

Now analyze this text:
{{INPUT}}

Remember: Return empty list if NO trigger phrases are found!
